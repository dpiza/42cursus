## About 42


42 is a global education initiative that proposes a new way of learning technology: no teachers, no classrooms, students learning from their fellow students (peer to peer learning), with a methodology that develops both computing and life skills. The 42 cursus is free for whoever is approved in its selection process. 


## Curriculum


The curriculum at 42 starts with the core curriculum. This experience sets the base for minimum skills, both human and technical. Following each student’s personal pace, it lasts a maximum of 18 months and lets students learn C programming, develop simple software using classic algorithms, discover access to the file system, and learn management of the UNIX process. It also includes a simple first approach to network architecture as well as system administration. The program also offers oriented programming and a client-server project. The core curriculum is the same on each and every campus in the network 42. Once you’ve completed this part, you can join intercampus and exchange projects.

### The Game

42 SP have a gamification system that awards badges for each approved project and each phase of the core curriculum, in a way to record the cadet's progression. With the approval of the Minitalk project, I concluded the first phase of the core curriculum.
